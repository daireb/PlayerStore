# Keep Documentation Updated

After making code changes, review whether ARCHITECTURE.md or README.md need updating:

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Update when: module responsibilities change, new modules are added/removed, data flow changes, design decisions are added or invalidated, diagrams become inaccurate.
- **README.md** — Update when: public API signatures change (new/removed/renamed methods, changed parameters or return types), schema markers change, config fields change, version number changes, installation instructions change, usage examples become incorrect.

Do not update docs for purely internal refactors that don't affect architecture or public API.
